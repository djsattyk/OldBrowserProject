# OldBrowserProject

Your task is to write some Java code to insert that would be inserted in every web page containing java that did the following:

You will most likely need to set up a virtual machine to test your program. Here goes how to set one up

If the user has one of a list of suitable (as defined by you) browsers fully up to date, it does absolutely nothing.
If the user has an older version of one of the suitable browsers it suggests an upgrade something like this:
You are using Opera version 5.0. You need to upgrade your browser to use this Applet.

Opera logo	Opera 8.53 with the Java 1.8.0_66 Plug-in. This is the browser I use myself, so it is the one most likely to render correctly.

If the user’s browser is up to date, just suggest a plug-in upgrade.
You are using Opera version 8.5 with and older Java Plugin 1.4.2. You need to upgrade your plug-in, but the browser is fine as is.

If the user has some other browser, it displays a selection of browsers and suggests updating like this:
This Applet requires one of the following up-to-date browsers:

Firefox	Firefox (Links to an external site.)	43.0.4	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE (Java RuntimeEnvironment). Its support of Java is erratic. Most widely supported next to IE. Many add-ins. Very fast rendering. Weak on table rendering. Best for printing. Fairly slow to start up. Often stalls on first page from a new site. Must hit reload.
SeaMonkey	SeaMonkey (Links to an external site.)	2.39	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. Similar to Firefox, with integrated Email.
Safari	Safari (Links to an external site.)	5.1.7	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. For both Macs and PCs. Cannot get it to run Java. Some rendering problems. Simple and stripped down.
Avant	Avant (Links to an external site.)	2016:01	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. It is a fast browser, especially at starting up. Has problems with JavaScript. Excellent at rendering and printing tables. It uses the Firefox or Chrome rendering engine. Handles Applets, but has trouble with Java Web Start.
Opera	Opera (Links to an external site.)	34.0.2036.25	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. It no longer its own rendering engine, which was its main advantage. It uses Chrome. No longer lets you configure your own editor. No bookmarks. You must click every Java Applet instance to view it. Implements SPDY for faster communication.
Google Chrome	Google Chrome (Links to an external site.)	40.0.2214.91	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. Dropped support for Java applets. Frequently automatically updated. Has no edit sourcebutton. Slow starting when it fiddles with a proxy. Displays CurrCon prices correctly. Poor downloading — it hides the fact it is doing so in the bottom left corner. Often downloads without you asking. Handles foreign language sites particularly well since it integrates with Google Translate. Best for interacting with Google. BrowserMark rates this as the fastest browser. Good for ecommerce. Can’t print white writing on a black background.
IE11	IE11 (Links to an external site.)	11.0.9600.17501	with the Java 1.8.0_66JRE. Not recommended. This browser is hopeless at Java, especially the 64-bit version. However, some websites will work with no other browser, though many work on everything but this eccentric browser.
Get Java	Oracle’s Java (Links to an external site.)	1.8.0_66	JRE
It would be nice to just provide a list of suitable browser names and a range of suitable version numbers including + to mean any future version and be done with it.
